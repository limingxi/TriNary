1. Requirement:
	The makefile uses g++ as default compiler, if you want to use
	other compilers, you should change makefile or use the two source
	files to build another project.
2. Files:
	main.cpp: the main program to test the code.
	Tri.h: The class and functions implemented in this file
	makefile: used for make
	README.txt: the readme file
3. Usage:
	In the command line, type in "make" and type enter.
	Now we have the file called "main" as an executable file.
	Either run "./main" or "make run" will start the program.
4. Additional:
	The test program cannot print out the tree, the only way to test
	is that user can insert or delete any value and use find to check
	if the functions work well.
